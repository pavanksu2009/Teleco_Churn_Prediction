# Churn Modelling - How to predict if a Telecomâ€™s customer will stay or leave.

We created an app to demonstrate the ability to apply best machine learning model to predict the likelihood of customer churn. We accomplished this using the following steps:

## 1. Clean the data

By reading the dataset into a dataframe using pandas,  we removed unnecessary data field customer IDs. 

## 2. Analyze initial DataFrame

Utilizing Matplotlib, Seaborn and Pandas, we next analyzed the data.

## 3. Machine Learning using 5 different models

We tested five different machine learning models (and used  in the final application) to predict customer churn, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbor, and XGBoost. 

## 4. Load model to display predictions on app

Finally, using Streamlit, we created the user-facing app to add information to our data set matching our initial dataframe to predict the likelihood of a customer departing the company. This was then deployed to Streamlit,
